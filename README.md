Project: University Management System

---

### Project Description

This **University Management System** was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment. The purpose of this project was to design and implement a system that manages the data of students, professors, and courses in a university environment. 
The system allows these users to interact with the data in a practical way, ensuring that all operations (like adding, editing, and deleting data) are properly handled through an easy-to-use menu interface. This project helped in applying OOP principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model real-world entities and their interactions within a system.

It supports three types of users: **Secretary**, **Professor**, and **Student**, each with specific functionalities:

- **Secretary**: Can manage the students, professors, and courses, assign professors to courses, and generate various reports related to grades and semester statistics.
- **Professor**: Can grade students, view their courses, and manage semester statistics for their assigned courses.
- **Student**: Can enroll in courses, view grades, and check the list of their enrolled and passed courses.

### Files
- **students.txt**: Contains student data.
- **professors.txt**: Contains professor data.
- **courses.txt**: Contains course data.

### How to Use
1. **Login** as a Secretary, Professor, or Student.
2. Perform actions according to your role (e.g., grade students, enroll in courses).
3. View or edit data as needed (students, professors, courses).
4. **Logout** when done.

### Requirements
- C++ with basic file I/O handling.
- Menu-driven interface to interact with the system.

Notes:
- Grade should be integer
- Required ECTS for graduation: 105 ECTS.
- Obligatory years for completion: 2 (4 semesters).
